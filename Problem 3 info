Approach:
In order to get around the error we were getting in the lab, 
I converted the characters into ints before addition and subtraction.
I created the repeating key with using mod
I made decrypt and encrypt their own functions
I added a menu to trigger the functions

Limitations:
It only does Letters(A-Z, a-z)
Spaces, numbers and symbols are not encrypted.
Menu gets called recursively, so it uses more memory as you continue to use it.
