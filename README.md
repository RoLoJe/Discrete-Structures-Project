Case: 2
Program: UCR Medical Center Volunteers

Program Description:
  The base of function of this program is to help assist in the selection of country for the “Doctors Without Borders Program” which helps in selecting a graduate student to be selected and sent to a specific location based on matched preferences such as specialized areas, language fluency and other specified preferences. After running the program, it sets a preference in the selection of a doctor to be paired with a country based on the physician’s preferences whether it’s an exact match or close to exact, thus forth the volunteer being matched with a country and sent to do volunteer work in their specific locations.

Usage:
  When a user runs the program they are able to input their specific preferences such as specialization and language preference, and based off the users input the program will be able to find a radomized match for a location for the student to be sent to for the Doctors without Borders program.

Program Approaches:
  As for approaches the program task asked for the assignment of the student to use both language and specialization to assign the student to a location, but rather than assigning a student off preference only, we set the program to assign the student randomly to a country based off their specifications such as language preference and specialization. In the process of creating this program, using probability and algorithms were used to make this program run as if its in a “Real World” situation.

Application of Course Concepts:
  Methods learned and applied in to the creation of this program from the course were probability and algorithms. Adding in the probability allowed the program to be in a more “real world” setting which gave equal chance of getting one of the few countries that matched the students specified language and specialization.

Case: 3
Program: Vigenere Cipher Decryption

Program Description:
  This program is a Cipher Encryption and Decryption program, which for the users who load this program can input a message to be encrypted and enter a key for the message they inputted earlier to be encrypted to now be decrypted. The program uses a substitution method for encryption.

Usage:
  When the user runs the program they are able to enter a message they want to have encrypted and enter a key for when they chose to have the message decrypted, they enter the key they entered previously and it reveals their decrypted message.

Program Approaches:
  A program approach that was used to create this program was the substitution cipher method. Along with the substitution method, a cast char as an int to retrieve the ascii value number. The cast char was used to solve an issue involving range with the characters used whether the character range was too high or too low, which in end would result in issues of output. A mod operator was utilized in a for loop to create a repeating key. “a-z” was set as 1-26 for the character shift, which “a” being 1.

Application of Course Concepts:
  One application of course concept used in help creating this programming was again the Substitution Method, which was learned in an earlier lab from class which helped assist in the base structure creation of the code.
